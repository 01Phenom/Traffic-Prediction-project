# Traffic Prediction Application

https://traffic-prediction-project.streamlit.app

## Overview

This is a traffic prediction application developed in Python using the Random Forest machine learning model. The application predicts whether traffic conditions are normal or high based on input parameters such as time, date, weather conditions, and historical traffic data.

The application is deployed using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web interface for users to input data and receive real-time traffic predictions.

## Features

- Predicts traffic conditions (normal or high) based on input data.
- User-friendly web interface created with Streamlit.
- Utilizes a Random Forest model with a high R-squared (R^2) score of 0.92 for accurate predictions.
